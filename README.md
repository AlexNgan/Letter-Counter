# Letter-Counter
This is a program written in Python which takes input of words as a .txt file and counts the number of lines, generates a list of 100 or the words at random, and counts the occurrence of each letter. 

To run the program, download all the files and save them together in one folder. Note that in LetterCounter.py, the last three lines may have to be changed based upon where the files are saved when you run the program.
